## [Next.Js](https://www.ideamotive.co/blog/nextjs-vs-react-which-javascript-framework-is-better-for-your-front-end)

One of the reasons we use React.js is that it makes our development of front-end easier. It allows and encourages us to build components and reuse them as many as possible. Plus, we don't have to worry too much about HTML too much with React.js. It seems like React.Js has "maximized" the simplification of frontend development. However, the website above showed another framework called Next.Js which makes development faster than React.js. Next.js is built on top of React.Js. Unlike React, Next.js do not need a router to create web pages, and its performance is faster. The deployment is simple as well. Yet, Next.Js also has some disadvantages. It is more inflexible about the router, and its community is much smaller than the community of React.

That is a truly surprising article. I cannot believe something can beat powerful React. I gotta say you provided me with something new to learn.

This is an impressing article. It is the first time I heard about Next.js. I cannot believe that there is a framework that is much faster and easier to use than React.js. Hope oneday I can use it in my project.

END END END END

I found this article very insteresting. Even though Next is definitely not as popular as React right now, the article has shown some of real advantages using Next over React. I believe as it gets more improvements and flexibility it will become widely adpoted by developers.
